ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Philophile

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in NLP, Ontologies, Knowledge graph, Similarity between concepts and similar kind of stuff. 
My main goal is to crack the mechanism of human understanding in order to help my fellow citizen have a better grasp at our complex world and overflowing information.
As a former student in Philosophy, I am also interested in all the implications of current and future AI uses, their limits, possibilities and threats.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning different NLP and Knowledge Graph techniques while trying my hands on a personal project, HP fanfiction Analysis you can find here.
